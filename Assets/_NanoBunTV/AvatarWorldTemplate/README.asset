  title: Avatar World Template (NanoBunTV)
  sections:
  - heading: What is this?
    text: A rework of the VRChat Home Kit package for use as a VRChat Avatar World,
      to help give a base for Avatar creators to build from and create their own
      Avatar world. Many Avatar creators have no clue how to use the Worlds SDK,
      that is exactly why I put together this package.
