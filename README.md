# Avatar World Template
## Created by [NathanBunTV](https://twitter.com/nathanbuntv)



A rework of the VRChat Home Kit package for use as a VRChat Avatar World, to help give a base for Avatar creators to build from and create their own Avatar world.

Many Avatar creators have no clue how to use the Worlds SDK, that is exactly why I put together this package.


If you fail to thoroughly read the documentation and something goes wrong, I will laugh at you.
